# Climate Zone Clustering for Agricultural Planning

## Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to cluster geographic regions based on their climate characteristics. This clustering can help in better understanding and planning for agricultural activities, such as crop selection, irrigation strategies, and pest management, tailored to specific climate zones.

## About Dataset
This Global Summaries dataset, known as GSOY for Yearly, contains a yearly resolution of meteorological elements from 1763 to present with updates applied weekly. The major parameters are: â€“ average annual temperature, average annual minimum and maximum temperatures; total annual precipitation and snowfall; departure from normal of the mean temperature and total precipitation; heating and cooling degree days; number of days that temperatures and precipitation are above or below certain thresholds; extreme annual minimum and maximum temperatures; number of days with fog; and number of days with thunderstorms. The primary input data source is the Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily (GHCN-Daily) dataset

### About Data source
**NOAA Climate Data:**

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides a wide range of climate data, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, and more.
You can access historical climate data from NOAA's Climate Data Online [portal](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C00947/html).
